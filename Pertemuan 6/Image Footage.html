    <p>Zenless Zone Zero is an action role-playing game. The player assumes the role of a Proxy (the protagonist known
        as Belle or Wise), a character who helps others explore alternate dimensions called Hollows.Over time, the Proxy
        will recruit new party members known as Agents to fight hostile entities called Ethereals and other enemies. In
        addition to the Proxy, players use rabbit-like robotic assistants known as Bangboos.</p>

    <p>The gameplay is split into two different modes: "TV Mode" and "Combat Mode." TV Mode gameplay resembles a 2D
        dungeon crawler game, with the Proxy roaming on tiles that resemble televisions to find treasure, solve puzzles
        and fight enemies. If the Proxy steps on an enemy tile, the party is sent to "Combat Mode," where they fight in
        a 3D hack and slash-like game mode.</p>
